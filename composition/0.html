    <!-- OTHER STUFF GOES HERE -->
    3 Short Pieces, Opus 0, are three of the pieces that I wrote during my 2018-2019 composition phase. Originally, when I wrote them, they consisted of <em>Two Short Pieces, Op. 2</em> (Opus 1 was a planned set of 24 preludes of which a few had already been written; those preludes because Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the <a href="./1.html">7 Miniatures, Op. 1</a>) and <em>Piece with Impossible Cadenza, Op. 3.</em> In 2020, I repackaged the five (at the time) preludes and the <em>Two Short Pieces</em> into the <em>7 Miniatures</em>, but didn't know what to do about <em>Piece with Impossible Cadenza</em> so I left it out. Eventually, I removed the cadenza and stuffed the piece into my <a href="#">24 Preludes, Op. 26</a>.
    <h2>1. "Odd Time Signatures"</h2>
    The first of the three pieces is in C major, and uses various unusual time signatures. Most of it is bad, but some of it is also <em>stupid</em> in addition to bad! (Such as the repeated-note passages). Measure 15 says "LOL" and measure 20 says "WHY". It was recycled as the last of my <a href="./1.html">7 Miniatures, Op. 1</a>.

    <h2>2. Untitled</h2>
    A cute little piece in G major, fairly simple, nothing interesting, neither especially good nor bad. One of my compositions of all time. It was recycled as the fourth of my <a href="./1.html">7 Miniatures, Op. 1</a>.
    <h2>3. "Impossible Cadenza"</h2>
    A short piece in E minor consisting of a fairly simple section, repeated twice, followed by a completely impossible series of runs (the "cadenza") in 16th notes at tempi ranging from quarter=200 to quarter=325, with nonsensical amounts of random articulations thrown in. Ends on a massive E minor chord... in second inversion. It was recycled as the fourth of my <a href="#">24 Preludes, Op. 26</a>.
